# Emotion-Detector
Created a Emotion Detector system using Machine Learning in Python
This project is an Emotion Detector built using machine learning in Python. It analyzes facial expressions in images and classifies them into different emotions such as happy, sad, angry, etc.
The Emotion Detector model was trained on the FER2013 dataset which is available on Kaggle, which contains facial expressions labeled with different emotions.
